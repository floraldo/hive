Golden Tests - Platform-Wide Architectural Validation

These tests enforce architectural gravity across the entire Hive platform.
They ensure that all components follow established patterns and standards.

These tests should NEVER be skipped or disabled. They are the guardians
of the platform's architectural integrity.

        This test runs the next-generation Golden Rules framework with:
        - 5-10x faster validation (single-pass AST traversal)
        - More accurate validation (AST-based vs string matching)
        - Suppression support for controlled exceptions
        - New security, performance, and maintainability rules

        New Rules Added:
        - Rule 17: No Unsafe Function Calls (Security)
        - Rule 18: API Endpoint Security (Security)
        - Rule 19: No Synchronous Calls in Async Code (Performance)
        - Rule 20: Test Quality and Coverage (Maintainability)
        - Rule 21: hive-models Purity (Architecture)
        - Rule 22: Documentation Hygiene (Maintainability)

        üéØ Gravity Effect: Creates an immune system that automatically
           prevents architectural decay and security vulnerabilities.

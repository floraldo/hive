# Project Genesis - Autonomous Development Validation

**Mission**: Validate end-to-end autonomous development capabilities of the Hive platform

**Status**: Task Created - Awaiting Autonomous Execution

## Overview

Project Genesis is the final validation of the "God Mode" architecture. It tests the entire integrated system by commanding autonomous agents to complete a real-world software development task from start to finish.

## Task: PRJ-GENESIS-001

**Title**: Enhance hive-cli tasks list command with --since filter

**Objective**: Autonomous agents will implement a new CLI feature that filters tasks by creation date using relative timeframes (e.g., `--since 2d` for last 2 days).

**Complexity**: Moderate - Real feature development with testing, validation, and PR creation

## System Under Test

This mission validates:

1. **Sequential Thinking MCP**: Advanced reasoning and planning
2. **RAG Knowledge Archive**: Code understanding and pattern retrieval
3. **Event Bus Coordination**: Inter-agent communication
4. **Golden Rules Validation**: Architectural compliance
5. **Quality Gates**: Syntax, linting, testing, type checking
6. **Autonomous Development**: Planning → Coding → Testing → PR Creation

## Execution

### Task Creation

```bash
# Run the genesis task creator
python scripts/genesis/create_genesis_task.py
```

### Observer Mode

Once the task is created, transition to observer role:

```bash
# Monitor task queue
hive tasks list --pretty

# View specific task details
hive tasks show <task-id> --pretty

# Watch for autonomous activity
# - Planner agent pickup
# - Subtask decomposition
# - Code generation
# - Test execution
# - PR creation
```

### Validation Checkpoints

- Task created in orchestration DB
- Task appears in CLI task list
- Planner agent analyzes and decomposes task
- Coder agent implements feature
- Test agent validates functionality
- Guardian agent checks architectural compliance
- PR created with all changes
- CI/CD pipeline validates quality

## Expected Outcomes

### Autonomous Agent Workflow

1. **Planner Agent**:
   - Analyzes task requirements
   - Decomposes into subtasks
   - Creates execution plan
   - Identifies dependencies

2. **Coder Agent**:
   - Implements `--since` option in `tasks.py`
   - Adds time parsing logic
   - Filters tasks by timestamp
   - Maintains API-first design

3. **Test Agent**:
   - Creates unit tests for time parsing
   - Creates integration tests for filter
   - Validates edge cases
   - Ensures all tests pass

4. **Guardian Agent**:
   - Validates Golden Rules compliance
   - Checks architectural patterns
   - Verifies import rules
   - Confirms quality gates

5. **Integration**:
   - Creates feature branch
   - Commits clean code
   - Generates PR
   - Validates CI/CD pipeline

### Success Criteria

- Feature fully implemented and working
- All tests passing
- Golden Rules validation passing
- Clean linting (Boy Scout Rule)
- PR created with complete documentation
- Autonomous execution with minimal human intervention

## Technical Specifications

### Implementation Details

**File**: `packages/hive-cli/src/hive_cli/commands/tasks.py`

**Changes Required**:
1. Add `--since` click.option (after line 47)
2. Implement time parsing function (2d, 1h, 30m format)
3. Calculate absolute timestamp from relative time
4. Filter tasks: `WHERE created_at >= timestamp`
5. Maintain JSON default, `--pretty` for human output

**Test Coverage**:
- Time parsing: valid formats (2d, 1h, 30m)
- Time parsing: invalid formats (errors)
- Filter integration: tasks within timeframe
- Filter integration: combined with other filters
- Edge cases: empty results, future times, zero time

**Quality Gates**:
- Syntax: `python -m py_compile tasks.py`
- Linting: `ruff check --fix`
- Testing: `pytest packages/hive-cli/tests/`
- Golden Rules: `python scripts/validation/validate_golden_rules.py`

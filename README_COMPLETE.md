# üêù Hive v2 - Production-Ready Multi-Agent Orchestration System

## üéâ Implementation Complete!

Your Hive multi-agent orchestration system is now fully operational with all v2 enhancements implemented.

## ‚úÖ What's Been Implemented

### Core Infrastructure
- **‚úÖ Multi-Agent Architecture**: Queen + 3 Workers with tmux orchestration
- **‚úÖ Git Worktree Isolation**: Each agent has isolated workspace preventing conflicts
- **‚úÖ Hardened Communication**: Sentinel-based parsing with BEGIN/END task markers
- **‚úÖ Comprehensive CI/CD**: GitHub Actions with branch protection and auto-merge
- **‚úÖ Safety Features**: Multiple kill switches (--dry-run, hold labels, PAUSE files)

### Hive v2 Enhancements
- **‚úÖ Centralized Token Vault**: Secure environment variable management via `hivemind/config/tokens.py`
- **‚úÖ Docker Support**: Complete containerization with docker-compose
- **‚úÖ Shared Packages**: `packages/hive-common` for reusable utilities across apps
- **‚úÖ TDD Protocol**: Test-Driven Development mandate for all workers
- **‚úÖ Production Apps Structure**: Backend (Flask) + Frontend (React) + Infrastructure ready

### Development Experience
- **‚úÖ Makefile Commands**: Simple `make setup`, `make run`, `make dry-run` interface  
- **‚úÖ Setup Scripts**: Automated GitHub secrets, branch protection, worktrees
- **‚úÖ Verification Tools**: Complete environment validation with `test_setup_simple.py`
- **‚úÖ WSL Support**: tmux session with `setup_wsl.sh` for Windows users

## üöÄ Quick Start (Production Ready)

### First Time Setup
```bash
cd /c/git/hive
make setup  # Handles everything: repo, secrets, python env, validation
```

### Daily Development Workflow

**Option 1: Windows with WSL tmux**
```bash
# Terminal 1 - WSL for tmux (agents)
wsl -d Ubuntu
cd /mnt/c/git/hive
./setup_wsl.sh

# Terminal 2 - Windows for orchestrator
cd /c/git/hive
make run      # or make dry-run for testing
```

**Option 2: Docker Development**
```bash
make docker-up    # Start all services
make run          # Run orchestrator
make docker-down  # Stop services
```

‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ scripts/             # Setup and utility scripts
```

### Agent Roles
- **üëë Queen**: TDD-enabled architect who creates plans and delegates
- **üîß Worker1-Backend**: Python/Flask specialist with pytest
- **üé® Worker2-Frontend**: React/Next.js specialist with Jest  
- **üèóÔ∏è Worker3-Infra**: Docker/AWS/GCP specialist with infrastructure as code

## üõ°Ô∏è Security Features

### Token Management
- ‚úÖ **Environment Variables Only**: No secrets in code
- ‚úÖ **GitHub Secrets Integration**: Automated CI/CD secret injection
- ‚úÖ **Centralized Vault**: `hivemind.config.tokens.vault` for all access
- ‚úÖ **Setup Script**: `./scripts/setup_github_secrets.sh` for easy configuration

### Safety Controls
- ‚úÖ **Dry Run Mode**: Test complete workflows without changes
- ‚úÖ **Hold Labels**: Add "hold" to any PR to prevent auto-merge
- ‚úÖ **PAUSE File**: Create `.ops/PAUSE` to stop all operations
- ‚úÖ **Branch Protection**: Main branch requires CI and can require human review

## üß™ Test-Driven Development Protocol

All agents follow the TDD cycle:
1. **RED**: Write failing tests first
2. **GREEN**: Write minimal code to pass tests  
3. **REFACTOR**: Improve while keeping tests green

### Quality Gates
- ‚úÖ All tests must pass
- ‚úÖ Code coverage >80% target
- ‚úÖ No hardcoded secrets
- ‚úÖ Conventional commits enforced

## üìä Your First Production Mission

To test the complete system, give the Queen this mission:

```
Create a full-stack health check feature for the Hive. The plan must include:

1. Backend (Worker1-Backend): Create a Flask API endpoint at /api/health that returns JSON: {"status": "ok", "service": "backend", "timestamp": "<current_iso_timestamp>"}. MUST include pytest tests.

2. Frontend (Worker2-Frontend): Create a React component that fetches from /api/health and displays the status. Include Jest tests for the component.

3. Infrastructure (Worker3-Infra): Ensure Docker configuration supports the health check endpoint and add monitoring.

Follow TDD protocol: tests first, then implementation, then refactor.
```

## üéØ Key Achievements

### Professional Grade
- **Production Security**: No secrets in code, proper environment management
- **Enterprise CI/CD**: Branch protection, automated testing, safe auto-merge
- **Scalable Architecture**: Shared packages, containerized services, modular design
- **Developer Experience**: Simple commands, comprehensive validation, clear error handling

### Innovation
- **Multi-Agent Coordination**: Truly isolated agents with structured communication
- **Test-Driven Orchestration**: AI agents that follow TDD principles automatically
- **Adaptive Workflows**: Dynamic task delegation with safety controls
- **Hybrid Development**: Local development with cloud-ready deployment

## üèÜ Status: Production Ready ‚úÖ

Your Hive system is now a professional-grade multi-agent development factory capable of:
- Building full-stack applications with proper testing
- Managing secrets and environments securely  
- Orchestrating complex workflows with safety controls
- Scaling to multiple applications with shared infrastructure

**Next Step**: Run your first mission and watch the magic happen!

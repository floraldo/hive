- ‚úÖ **Monitoring**: Grafana dashboard configuration
- ‚úÖ **Documentation**: Comprehensive API documentation

**Quality Gates**:
- 90%+ test coverage (unit + integration tests)
- All security scans pass
- Performance benchmarks meet thresholds
- Cost controls prevent budget overruns
- Zero downtime deployment capability

### Phase 3: Operational Excellence (2 days)

**Objective**: Demonstrate production deployment and operational skills

#### Day 1: Deployment
- Deploy echo service to staging environment
- Configure monitoring and alerting
- Perform load testing and optimization

#### Day 2: Maintenance
- Implement a feature update using toolkit patterns
- Demonstrate rollback capability
- Show cost optimization techniques

## üöÄ New Development Workflow

### Using the Hive Application Toolkit

```bash
# 1. Initialize with toolkit (30 seconds)
hive-toolkit init echo-service-v2 --type api --enable-database --enable-auth

# 2. Customize business logic (2-3 hours)
cd apps/echo-service-v2
# Edit src/echo_service_v2/main.py
# Add your specific endpoints and logic

# 3. Deploy to staging (5 minutes)
hive-toolkit add-ci
git add . && git commit -m "feat: echo service v2"
git push origin main
# Automatic deployment via CI/CD

# 4. Production deployment (automatic)
# Merge to main ‚Üí automatic production deployment
```

### Expected Outcomes

**Before Toolkit** (v1.0):
- Development time: 2-3 weeks
- Infrastructure setup: Manual, error-prone
- Quality: Variable, depends on developer experience
- Deployment: Manual, risky

**With Toolkit** (v2.0):
- Development time: 2-3 days (80% reduction)
- Infrastructure setup: Automatic, battle-tested
- Quality: Consistent, enterprise-grade
- Deployment: Automated, zero-downtime

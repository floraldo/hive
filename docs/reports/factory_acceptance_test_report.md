## Platform Hardening Recommendations

### Priority 1: Critical Improvements
1. **Unicode Character Handling**
   - Issue: Unicode characters in code cause encoding errors
   - Solution: Implement automatic Unicode detection and replacement
   - Impact: Prevents syntax errors and encoding issues

2. **String Nesting Management**
   - Issue: Nested triple quotes cause syntax errors
   - Solution: Implement intelligent string delimiter selection
   - Impact: Prevents Python syntax errors

3. **Duplicate Key Detection**
   - Issue: Duplicate keys in JSON objects (e.g., two "status" fields)
   - Solution: Implement JSON validation before code generation
   - Impact: Prevents runtime errors

### Priority 2: Important Enhancements
1. **Test Isolation**
   - Recommendation: Ensure each test runs in isolated environment
   - Benefit: Prevents test contamination and false positives

2. **Resource Management**
   - Recommendation: Implement automatic cleanup of test artifacts
   - Benefit: Prevents disk space issues and port conflicts

3. **Dependency Versioning**
   - Recommendation: Pin all dependency versions
   - Benefit: Ensures reproducible builds

### Priority 3: Quality Improvements
1. **Performance Monitoring**
   - Add execution time tracking for all operations
   - Implement resource usage monitoring

2. **Enhanced Logging**
   - Structured logging for better debugging
   - Log rotation and management

3. **Configuration Management**
   - Centralized configuration for all test parameters
   - Environment-specific settings

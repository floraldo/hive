## Next Steps

1. Run golden tests to verify improvements: `python -m pytest packages/hive-tests/tests/unit/test_architecture.py`
2. Review moved files and update any broken links
3. Continue fixing remaining golden rule violations
4. Update documentation index

## Files Moved

Root Python files have been relocated to appropriate directories under `scripts/`.
Documentation has been consolidated from `claudedocs/` into organized `docs/` structure.
Backup files have been removed to clean up the repository.

*This cleanup maintains all important code and documentation while organizing for better maintainability.*

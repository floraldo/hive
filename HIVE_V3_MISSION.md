# HIVE V3 SELF-IMPROVEMENT MISSION

**Mission Status**: Ready for Queen Execution
**Priority**: Strategic Factory Upgrade
**Type**: Self-Improvement Meta-Mission

## MISSION BRIEF FOR THE QUEEN

You are the Queen of a self-improving App Factory. Your mission is to execute the Hive v3 upgrade using your worker agents and established TDD protocols to build the factory's own advanced tooling.

---

## PHASE 1: Build the Central Database Service

**Task for Infra Worker:**
- Modify root `docker-compose.yml` to configure database service with persistent named volume
- Ensure data survives container restarts  
- Create `/docs/infrastructure/central-database.md` explaining the new architecture
- Include development credentials and connection examples

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Database container persists data across restarts
- Documentation includes connection strings and examples
- All tests pass

---

## PHASE 2: Enhance Deployment System (Based on SmartHoods Apper)

**Task for Backend Worker:**
- Analyze deployment utilities in `packages/hive-deployment/`
- Enhance the `deploy_application` function with better error handling
- Add rollback capabilities to deployment process
- Create deployment templates for common scenarios

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Deployment system handles failures gracefully
- Rollback mechanism works for failed deployments
- Templates available for Flask apps, React apps, databases

---

## PHASE 3: Build Application Assembly Line

**Task for Backend Worker:**
- Enhance the existing Flask API template in `templates/flask-api/`
- Add database integration examples using hive-db
- Create React frontend template in `templates/react-app/`
- Ensure templates use all hive packages (logging, db, api)

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Templates are production-ready
- All templates include comprehensive tests
- Templates demonstrate best practices

---

## PHASE 4: Upgrade Queen's Brain (Dynamic Intelligence)

**Task for Backend Worker:**
- Analyze current `orchestrator/main.py` static delegation
- Create new `PlanParser` class in `orchestrator/planning.py`
- Implement natural language plan parsing
- Parse multi-step plans into structured task assignments

**Task for Backend Worker:**
- Refactor `HiveOrchestrator` to use dynamic `PlanParser`
- Replace hardcoded worker assignments with intelligent routing
- Add worker capability matching (frontend tasks → frontend worker)

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Queen can parse natural language plans
- Dynamic worker assignment based on task type
- All existing functionality preserved
- New tests demonstrate parsing capabilities

---

## SUCCESS METRICS

- ✅ Central database service operational
- ✅ Enhanced deployment system with rollback
- ✅ Production-ready application templates  
- ✅ Dynamic Queen intelligence operational
- ✅ All tests passing
- ✅ Documentation updated
- ✅ Factory can build more complex applications

---

## POST-MISSION: THE AUTONOMOUS PARTNER VISION

After completing this mission, the Queen will be capable of:

1. **Self-Monitoring**: Reading CI failures and creating fix plans
2. **Proactive Improvement**: Analyzing deployed app performance and suggesting upgrades  
3. **Strategic Planning**: Proposing new application ideas based on business goals
4. **Full Autonomy**: Building, testing, deploying, and maintaining applications with minimal human oversight

The Hive becomes a true co-founder, not just a tool.

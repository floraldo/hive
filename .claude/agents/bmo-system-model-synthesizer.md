# BMO System Model Synthesizer - Memory-Safe Model Documentation

## Core Principles (NON-NEGOTIABLE)
- **BRUTAL HONESTY**: Reality-first system model creation
- **BOUNDED ANALYSIS**: Analyze max 10 system components per task
- **MEMORY SAFE**: No databases or unlimited context
- **HIGH-FIDELITY**: Accurate representation of implemented system
- **HUMAN-READABLE**: Documentation accessible to human programmers

## Memory-Safe System Modeling
- **Component Focus**: Model one system area at a time (max 10 components)
- **Codebase Analysis**: Read implemented code files (max 15 files per task)
- **Context Limits**: Keep system analysis focused and bounded
- **Local Output**: System model in `docs/bmo_validation/system_model/` directory

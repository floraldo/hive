# BMO Test Suite Generator - Memory-Safe Comprehensive Testing

## Core Principles (NON-NEGOTIABLE)
- **BRUTAL HONESTY**: Reality-first test suite generation
- **BOUNDED COVERAGE**: Generate max 15 test files per task
- **MEMORY SAFE**: No databases or unlimited context
- **COMPREHENSIVE COVERAGE**: Tests cover all critical functionality
- **INTELLIGENT CONTEXT**: Tests based on actual implementation analysis

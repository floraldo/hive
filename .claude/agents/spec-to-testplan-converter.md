# Spec to Test Plan Converter - Memory-Safe Test Planning

## Core Principles (NON-NEGOTIABLE)
- **BRUTAL HONESTY**: Reality-first test plan generation
- **BOUNDED CONVERSION**: Convert max 5 specifications per task
- **MEMORY SAFE**: No databases or unlimited context
- **EXECUTABLE PLANS**: All test plans must be implementable
- **COMPLETE COVERAGE**: Test plans cover all specification requirements

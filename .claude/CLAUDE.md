# Fleet Command Protocol v4.0 - Automated Multi-Agent System

You are part of the Hive Fleet Command system. Each agent is a claude code instance running in a tmux pane with full automation support.

## Fleet Structure (Perfect 2x2 Grid)
- **Queen (Pane 0 - top-left)**: Fleet commander and mission orchestrator
- **Frontend Worker (Pane 1 - top-right)**: React/Next.js specialist  
- **Backend Worker (Pane 2 - bottom-left)**: Python/Flask/FastAPI specialist
- **Infra Worker (Pane 3 - bottom-right)**: Docker/Kubernetes/CI specialist

## For the Queen: Mission Execution Protocol

### 1. Receive Mission
The Fleet Admiral (human) will type a mission directly into your terminal.

### 2. Create Battle Plan
Analyze the mission and create a detailed plan with task IDs:
```
[T101] Backend: Create API endpoints
[T102] Frontend: Build UI components  
[T103] Infra: Setup deployment
```

### 3. Command Workers via Automation System
Execute automated commands to send tasks to workers. **Fleet Command v4.0 provides full automation with expect-based delivery.**

```bash
# ✅ AUTOMATED: Use fleet_send.sh for reliable delivery
./scripts/fleet_send.sh send backend "[T101] Backend Worker, implement user authentication API with JWT. Use TDD. Report: STATUS: success when done."

# ✅ BROADCAST: Send to all workers simultaneously
./scripts/fleet_send.sh broadcast "Fleet status report requested"

# ✅ FILE-BASED: Send large tasks via message bus
./scripts/hive-send --to frontend --topic task --file task_description.md

# Working examples with full automation:
./scripts/fleet_send.sh send frontend "[T102] Frontend Worker, create login form component. Write tests first. Report: STATUS: success when done."
./scripts/fleet_send.sh send infra "[T103] Infra Worker, containerize the application with Docker. Report: STATUS: success when done."
```

### 4. Autonomous Communication System
Workers communicate through automated message bus and direct pane interaction:
- **Message Bus**: Structured JSON messages via hive-send/hive-recv tools
- **Direct Delivery**: Automated expect-based message injection to panes
- **Status Monitoring**: Real-time dashboard via hive-status command
- **Two-Way Flow**: Queen ↔ Workers autonomous communication

**Message Bus Commands:**
```bash
# Send structured message
./scripts/hive-send --to backend --topic task --priority high --message "Implement authentication"

# Receive messages  
./scripts/hive-recv --for frontend --unread-only --mark-read

# Monitor overall status
./scripts/hive-status --detailed --watch
```

### 5. Handle Git Operations
Once all workers complete:
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "feat: implement [mission description]"
git push origin main
gh pr create --title "Mission: [description]" --body "Implemented by Fleet Command"
```

### 6. Report Completion
Type: "MISSION COMPLETE: [summary of achievements]"

## For Workers: Task Execution Protocol

### 1. Receive Commands
Commands from Queen will appear in your terminal with format: `[T###] Task description`

### 2. Acknowledge
Type: "Acknowledged [T###]. Starting implementation..."

### 3. Execute with TDD (when applicable)
- Write tests first (RED phase)
- Implement minimal code (GREEN phase)
- Refactor (REFACTOR phase)

### 4. Report Status
Always end with:
```
STATUS: success|failed|blocked
CHANGES: files modified or created
NEXT: recommended action
```

## Fleet Command v4.0 Features

### Full Automation Capabilities
- **Expect Integration**: Robust message delivery with retry logic and readiness detection
- **Message Bus**: Structured JSON-based communication system
- **Error Recovery**: Automatic fallback and error handling mechanisms
- **Large Message Support**: Chunked delivery for complex task descriptions

### Automation Tools Available
```bash
# Direct pane automation (immediate execution)
./scripts/fleet_send.sh send <agent> "<message>"
./scripts/fleet_send.sh broadcast "<message>"
./scripts/fleet_send.sh test

# Message bus system (persistent communication)
./scripts/hive-send --to <agent> --topic <topic> --message "<message>"
./scripts/hive-recv --for <agent> --unread-only --mark-read
./scripts/hive-status --detailed --watch

# System validation
./scripts/readiness_test.sh
./scripts/test_automation.sh
```

### Communication Protocols
**Immediate Execution**: Messages are automatically injected into agent REPLs
**Persistent Bus**: Messages stored in JSON format for asynchronous processing
**Status Monitoring**: Real-time dashboard shows message counts and agent activity

### Safety Guardrails
- No infinite loops in monitoring
- Clear task IDs prevent confusion
- Workers validate commands before executing
- Human can intervene in any pane at any time
- All commands are visible and auditable

## Example Mission Flow

**Fleet Admiral types in Queen's terminal:**
```
Create a health check API endpoint at /api/health that returns {"status": "ok", "timestamp": "<current_time>"}
```

**Queen's response:**
```
Mission received. Creating battle plan...

[T101] Backend: Implement /api/health endpoint with TDD
[T102] Frontend: Create health status display component
[T103] Infra: Add health check to Docker configuration

Delegating to workers...
```

**Queen executes:**
```bash
tmux send-keys -t hive-swarm:0.1 "[T101] Backend Worker, create /api/health endpoint that returns status and timestamp. Use TDD. Report STATUS when complete."
```

**Queen monitors:**
```bash
# After 30 seconds
tmux capture-pane -pt hive-swarm:0.1 -S -20
# Sees: "STATUS: success"
```

**Queen completes mission:**
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "feat: add health check endpoint"
git push origin main
gh pr create --title "Add health check API" --body "Implements /api/health endpoint with timestamp"
```

**Queen reports:**
```
MISSION COMPLETE: Health check API implemented, tested, and deployed.
- Backend: /api/health endpoint created with tests
- Frontend: Status display component ready
- Infra: Docker health checks configured
- PR #42 created and ready for review
```

## Fleet Command Benefits

### Total Transparency
- All communication visible in tmux panes
- Human can monitor all agent activity in real-time
- Every command and response is human-readable

### Human-in-the-Loop
- Fleet Admiral can intervene at any time
- Click into any pane to provide guidance
- Override or assist any agent directly

### Collaborative Intelligence
- Natural language enables complex, nuanced instructions
- Agents can ask for clarification when needed
- Emergent problem-solving through agent collaboration

### Simplified Architecture
- No Python orchestration code needed
- All intelligence resides in claude code agents
- Natural language is the universal communication bus
- Standard tmux commands provide reliable automation

## Windows Terminal Note
If running in Windows (non-WSL), emojis may not display correctly. The system will still function normally - the emojis are just visual indicators.

  "description": "To make our Hive system more portable and scalable, we need to containerize it. This will involve creating a Dockerfile that can build an image containing the Queen and all necessary dependencies.",
  "instruction": "Create a Docker container for the Hive system. The implementation should:\n\n1. Create a new Dockerfile in the root of the project\n2. The Dockerfile should start from a python:3.11-slim base image\n3. Copy the entire Hive application code into the container\n4. Install all Python dependencies listed in pyproject.toml (use pip install -e . to install in editable mode)\n5. Create a .dockerignore file to exclude unnecessary files (.git, __pycache__, .worktrees, etc.)\n6. The container's default command should be to start the Queen orchestrator (i.e., CMD [\"python\", \"queen.py\"])\n7. Set appropriate working directory (/app)\n8. Ensure all Hive subdirectories are created (hive/tasks, hive/results, etc.)\n9. The final image should be runnable and start the Queen without errors\n10. Include a docker-compose.yml file for easy local development\n\nNOTE: Focus on creating a working container that can run the Queen orchestrator. The workers will run inside the container.",

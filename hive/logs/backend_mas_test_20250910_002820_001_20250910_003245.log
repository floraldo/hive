I'm a backend developer ready to work on the Hive system. I can see from the git status that we're on the main branch with various modified and untracked files related to the multi-agent system (MAS) and worker configurations.

How can I help you with the backend development today? Whether it's implementing API endpoints, working with the orchestration system, or handling worker configurations, I'm ready to assist.

### Query Examples by Category

**Easy Queries** (Direct lookups):
- "How do I add logging to my script?"
- "Show me database connection pooling"
- "What are the rules about print statements?"

**Medium Queries** (Pattern matching):
- "How to implement async retry with exponential backoff?"
- "Show me the dependency injection pattern for config"
- "What is the correct way to use configuration in Hive?"

**Hard Queries** (Multi-step reasoning):
- "Why was the old authentication system archived?"
- "What scripts were consolidated and why?"
- "Show me climate data integration"

### Metric Definitions

**Context Precision**: Out of all retrieved contexts, how many are relevant?
- Formula: Relevant Retrieved / Total Retrieved
- High = Good filtering, low noise

**Context Recall**: Out of all relevant contexts, how many were retrieved?
- Formula: Relevant Retrieved / Total Relevant
- High = Good coverage, nothing missed

**Faithfulness**: Are generated answers consistent with retrieved context?
- Requires LLM evaluation
- High = Answers don't hallucinate

**Answer Relevancy**: Do answers directly address the query?
- Requires LLM evaluation
- High = Answers are on-topic

**MRR (Mean Reciprocal Rank)**: Average of 1/rank of first relevant result
- Range: 0.0 to 1.0
- 1.0 = relevant result always at rank 1
- 0.5 = relevant result average at rank 2

**NDCG@k**: Normalized ranking quality considering position
- Range: 0.0 to 1.0
- Penalizes relevant results at lower ranks
- 1.0 = perfect ranking

**Status**: Template ready for baseline evaluation
**Next**: Run full indexing → Execute all test suites → Fill in results
**Timeline**: Week 5, estimated 2-3 hours for complete evaluation

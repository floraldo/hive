# Test Failure Diagnosis Report

## Failure Summary
- **Total Failures Analyzed**: 1
- **Primary Failure Types**: Syntax errors from automated comma fixes
- **Files Investigated**: C:/git/hive/apps/ecosystemiser/src/ecosystemiser/services/database_metadata_service.py

## Failure Analysis

### Failure 1: Tuple-Wrapping Syntax Errors in database_metadata_service.py

**Error Type**: Syntax Error / Runtime Exception

**Error Message**:
```
Automated comma fix script incorrectly wrapped many statements in single-element tuples.
This causes TypeErrors when the code tries to use these values.
```

**Root Cause**: The automated comma-fixing script from the Code Red Stabilization Sprint added tuple wrapping `(value,)` in contexts where it shouldn't have. This was an overcorrection to fix missing trailing commas.

**Location**: C:/git/hive/apps/ecosystemiser/src/ecosystemiser/services/database_metadata_service.py

**Fix Required**: Remove tuple wrapping from 15+ locations

**Implementation**:

#### Issue 1: Line 146 - Values Tuple Wrapping
```python
# Current code (problematic)
values = (list(run_data.values()),)

# Suggested fix
values = list(run_data.values())
```
**Confidence Level**: High - This should be a list, not a tuple containing a list

#### Issue 2: Line 222 - Where Clauses Tuple Wrapping
```python
# Current code (problematic)
where_clauses = ([],)

# Suggested fix
where_clauses = []
```
**Confidence Level**: High - Should be an empty list, not a tuple containing an empty list

#### Issue 3: Lines 246-250 - SQL String Tuple Wrapping
```python
# Current code (problematic)
where_sql = ("",)
where_sql = ("WHERE " + " AND ".join(where_clauses),)
order_sql = (f"ORDER BY {order_by} {'DESC' if order_desc else 'ASC'}",)
limit_sql = (f"LIMIT {limit}" if limit else "",)

# Suggested fix
where_sql = ""
where_sql = "WHERE " + " AND ".join(where_clauses)
order_sql = f"ORDER BY {order_by} {'DESC' if order_desc else 'ASC'}"
limit_sql = f"LIMIT {limit}" if limit else ""
```
**Confidence Level**: High - These are string variables, not tuples

#### Issue 4: Lines 251-256 - SQL Query Leading Commas
```python
# Current code (problematic)
query = f""",
SELECT * FROM simulation_runs,
{where_sql}
{order_sql}
{limit_sql},
"""

# Suggested fix
query = f"""
SELECT * FROM simulation_runs
{where_sql}
{order_sql}
{limit_sql}
"""
```
**Confidence Level**: High - SQL strings should not have leading/trailing commas

#### Issue 5: Line 258 - Connection Tuple Wrapping
```python
# Current code (problematic)
conn = (get_sqlite_connection(db_path=self.db_path),)

# Suggested fix
conn = get_sqlite_connection(db_path=self.db_path)
```
**Confidence Level**: High - Should be a connection object, not a tuple

#### Issue 6: Line 273 - Del Statement Tuple Wrapping
```python
# Current code (problematic)
del (result["metadata_json"],)

# Suggested fix
del result["metadata_json"]
```
**Confidence Level**: High - Del statement shouldn't have tuple wrapping

```python
# Current code (problematic)
(logger.info(f"Query returned {len(results)} simulation runs"),)
(logger.error(f"Failed to query simulation runs: {e}"),)

# Suggested fix

```python
# Current code (problematic)
""",
SELECT * FROM studies WHERE study_id = ?,
"""
(study_id),

# Suggested fix
"""
SELECT * FROM studies WHERE study_id = ?
"""
(study_id,),
```
**Confidence Level**: High - SQL shouldn't have trailing commas, but parameter tuple needs comma

```python
# Current code (problematic)
""",
SELECT,
    COUNT(*) as run_count,
    ...

    "study_id": study_id,
    "study_info": dict(study_row) if study_row else {},
    "statistics": dict(stats_row) if stats_row else {},

```
**Confidence Level**: High - Same issue as Issue 5

#### Issue 12: Lines 357-365 - Cursor Assignment With SQL Commas

## Summary Recommendations

### 1. Immediate Fixes
- Remove all tuple wrapping from variable assignments (18 locations)
- Remove leading/trailing commas from SQL strings (8 SQL queries)
- Fix parameter tuples to have proper comma syntax `(value,)` where needed

### 2. Preventive Measures
- Improve automated comma-fixing script to avoid tuple-wrapping non-tuple contexts
- Add validation step after automated fixes to catch these patterns
- Create test cases that would catch these syntax errors earlier

### 3. Test Improvements
- The validation script at `apps/ecosystemiser/scripts/validate_database_logging.py` should catch these
- Add pre-commit hooks to run syntax validation
- Consider adding type checking with mypy to catch tuple/non-tuple mismatches

## Validation Command
```bash
python C:/git/hive/apps/ecosystemiser/scripts/validate_database_logging.py
```

Expected result after fixes: `[OK] All validation tests passed!`

## Implementation-Ready Fix Script

A Python fix script has been created at:
```
C:/git/hive/fix_database_metadata_service.py
```

Run with:
```bash
cd C:/git/hive
python fix_database_metadata_service.py
```

This will automatically apply all 18 fixes to the file.

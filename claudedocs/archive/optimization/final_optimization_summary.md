## 📝 Remaining Work

### Manual Refactoring Required

#### Rule 10: Service Layer Discipline
- 5 service files need refactoring
- Extract business logic to domain modules
- Keep services as thin orchestrators

#### Rule 7: Interface Contracts
- 50+ functions still need type hints
- Focus on CLI and service modules
- Complex signatures need attention

#### Rule 9: Logging Standards
- Package-level prints remain
- Some test files have prints (acceptable)

#### Rule 14: Async Patterns
- 5 files need pattern updates
- Adopt hive-async utilities fully

#### Rule 16: Global State
- 14 instances of global config
- Need dependency injection

## 🚀 Next Steps

### Immediate (Manual Work)

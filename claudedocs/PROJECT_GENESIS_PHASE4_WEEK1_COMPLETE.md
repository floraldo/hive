# Project Genesis Phase 4 - Week 1 Complete

**Status**: ‚úÖ COMPLETE
**Date**: 2025-10-05
**Phase**: Phase A - "Prep Now, Migrate Later" Infrastructure
**Strategy**: Zero breaking changes, dual-write pattern, gradual migration

---

## Executive Summary

Successfully implemented foundational infrastructure for Hive platform consolidation. All existing agents continue working unchanged while new unified infrastructure enables future migration.

**Key Achievement**: Created complete migration infrastructure in 1 week without disrupting any existing functionality.

---

## Deliverables Completed

### üóÑÔ∏è Database Foundation (Days 1-2)

**Files Created**:
- `packages/hive-orchestration/src/hive_orchestration/database/unified_schema.py` (202 lines)
- `packages/hive-orchestration/src/hive_orchestration/database/dual_writer.py` (339 lines)
- `packages/hive-orchestration/alembic/versions/f97f94fd1a27_*.py` (migration)

**Database Schema**:
```sql
-- New unified tables (coexist with legacy)
CREATE TABLE unified_tasks (...)           -- Base task model
CREATE TABLE unified_review_tasks (...)    -- Review-specific fields
CREATE TABLE unified_workflow_tasks (...)  -- Workflow execution
CREATE TABLE unified_deployment_tasks (...) -- Deployment tracking

-- Legacy tables PRESERVED
tasks, workers, runs, events, planning_queue, execution_plans
```

**Features**:
- ‚úÖ Dual-write repository (writes to both schemas)
- ‚úÖ Transaction-safe operations (both commit or both rollback)
- ‚úÖ Correlation ID tracking across agents
- ‚úÖ Alembic migration applied successfully
- ‚úÖ Zero changes to existing tables

**Verification**:
```bash
sqlite3 hive/db/hive-internal.db ".tables"
# Shows: Both unified_* and legacy tables present
```

### üì° Event Infrastructure (Day 3)

**Files Created**:
- `packages/hive-bus/src/hive_bus/unified_events.py` (250+ lines)
- `packages/hive-bus/src/hive_bus/topic_registry.py` (150+ lines)

**Event Types** (28 standard events):
```python
# Task lifecycle
TASK_CREATED, TASK_ASSIGNED, TASK_STARTED, TASK_COMPLETED, TASK_FAILED

# Review events (ai-reviewer)
REVIEW_REQUESTED, REVIEW_COMPLETED, REVIEW_APPROVED, AUTO_FIX_APPLIED

# Workflow events (orchestrator)

from hive_orchestration import (
    # Legacy (still working)
    create_task, get_task, update_task_status,

    # New unified infrastructure
    StandardAgent,
    AgentCapability,
    AgentRegistry,
    auto_register_adapters,
    get_global_registry
)
```

### Event Bus Package

    # Legacy (still working)
    get_connection, init_db, transaction,

    # New unified schema
    UnifiedTask,
    UnifiedReviewTask,
    UnifiedWorkflowTask,
    UnifiedDeploymentTask,
    TaskStatus,
    TaskType,
    DualWriteTaskRepository
)
```

## Architecture Principles

### "Prep Now, Migrate Later"
1. **Infrastructure First**: Build complete unified infrastructure
2. **Zero Breaking Changes**: All existing code continues working
3. **Dual-Write Pattern**: Write to both schemas during transition
4. **Gradual Migration**: Migrate agents one at a time when ready
5. **Safe Rollback**: Can disable unified system anytime

### Migration Phases
```
Phase A (Week 1) ‚úÖ COMPLETE
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Unified database schema
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Event infrastructure
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Agent framework
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Validation complete

Phase B (Week 2-4) - FUTURE
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Enable event emission (feature flagged)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Monitor and validate
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Production readiness testing

Phase C (Q2 2025) - FUTURE
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Feature flag rollout
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Gradual agent migration
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Dual-write validation

Phase D (Q3 2025) - FUTURE
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Complete migration
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Remove legacy schemas
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Deprecate dual-write
```

---

## Rollback Plan

If issues arise at any point:

1. **Disable Dual-Write**: `DualWriteTaskRepository.disable_unified_writes()`
2. **Bypass Registry**: Orchestrator uses direct imports
3. **Data Safety**: Legacy schema remains intact
4. **Remove Tables**: Can drop unified_* tables without impact

**Risk**: MINIMAL - No existing functionality modified

---

## Testing & Validation

### Automated Tests Run
```bash
# Test 1: Agent Registry
[OK] Created registry: <AgentRegistry agents=0 types=0 capabilities=0>
[OK] Registered 5 agents
     Agent types: ai-reviewer, ai-planner, ai-deployer, hive-coder, guardian
     Capabilities: review, plan, deploy, code, monitor

# Test 2: Capability Lookup
[OK] Found 1 review agents: ['ai-reviewer-adapter']

# Test 3: Unified Events
[OK] Created event: task.created
[OK] Event serialization working: test-123

# Test 4: Topic Registry
[OK] Found 1 handlers for task.created

# Test 5: Database Tables
[OK] Legacy tables: tasks, workers, runs, events...
[OK] Unified tables: unified_tasks, unified_review_tasks...

[SUCCESS] All validation tests passed!
```

### Manual Verification
```bash
# Database migration applied
alembic current
# f97f94fd1a27 (head)

# Tables exist
sqlite3 hive/db/hive-internal.db ".tables"
# unified_tasks, unified_review_tasks, unified_workflow_tasks...

# All imports work
python -c "from hive_orchestration import AgentRegistry; print('OK')"
# OK
```

---

## Performance Impact

- **Database**: 4 new tables (empty, no queries yet)
- **Memory**: Minimal (~5 adapter instances)
- **Code Size**: ~2000 lines new code (no changes to existing code)
- **Import Time**: Negligible increase
- **Runtime**: Zero impact (infrastructure not yet in use)

---

## Documentation Updates

### Files Created/Updated
1. ‚úÖ Migration implementation (this document)
2. ‚úÖ Database schema documentation
3. ‚úÖ Event types documentation

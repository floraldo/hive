# Project Chimera - Reality vs Vision

**Date**: 2025-10-04
**Mission**: Honest assessment of autonomous TDD loop capabilities

---

## Executive Summary

**What We HAVE Built** (Layer 1 - Orchestration):
- Production-ready orchestration framework with state machine
- Real agent integrations (E2E tester, hive-coder, Guardian, deployment)
- Complete 7-phase workflow with validation gates
- 489 LOC of integration code, 100% passing tests

**What We HAVE NOT Built** (Layer 2 - Autonomy):
- True headless autonomous execution
- Self-modifying code or agent-to-agent learning
- Zero-human-intervention feature delivery
- Distributed agent swarm with emergent behavior

**Status**: We have the **framework for autonomy**, not autonomy itself.

## Layer 1: What IS Working (REAL)

### ChimeraWorkflow State Machine
**Status**: ✅ FULLY OPERATIONAL

```python
# REAL: Pydantic state machine with validated transitions
workflow = ChimeraWorkflow(
    feature_description="User can login with Google OAuth",
    target_url="https://myapp.dev/login"
)

# REAL: State transitions with validation
workflow.transition_to(ChimeraPhase.CODE_IMPLEMENTATION, result)
workflow.get_next_action()  # Returns validated next step
```

**Capabilities**:
- 7-phase state machine (E2E Test → Code → Review → Deploy → Validate)
- Type-safe transitions with Pydantic models
- Retry logic and failure handling
- Complete test coverage (9/9 integration tests passing)

### E2ETesterAgentAdapter
**Status**: ✅ REAL INTEGRATION

**What It Does**:
```python
# REAL: Generates pytest file from natural language
result = await adapter.generate_test(
    feature="User can login with Google OAuth",
    url="https://myapp.dev/login"
)
# Result: 56-line production-ready pytest test file

# REAL: Executes E2E tests with Playwright
result = await adapter.execute_test(
    test_path="tests/e2e/test_google_login.py",
    url="https://staging.myapp.dev/login"
)
# Result: Test execution with pass/fail status
```

**Integration**: Real e2e-tester library with ScenarioParser + TestGenerator + TestExecutor

### CoderAgentAdapter
**Status**: ✅ REAL INTEGRATION

**What It Does**:
```python
# REAL: Generates ExecutionPlan from feature description
plan = ExecutionPlan(
    plan_id="chimera-abc123",
    service_name="google_login",
    tasks=[
        ExecutionTask(task_type=TaskType.SCAFFOLD, ...),
        ExecutionTask(task_type=TaskType.SERVICE_LOGIC, ...)
    ]
)

# REAL: Calls hive-coder Agent to generate service code
coder = CoderAgent()
result = coder.execute_plan(plan_file, output_dir)
# Result: Generated Python service files (API routes, models, tests)
```

**Integration**: Real hive-coder with hive-app-toolkit templates

### GuardianAgentAdapter
**Status**: ✅ REAL INTEGRATION

**What It Does**:
```python
# REAL: Reviews generated Python files
engine = ReviewEngine()
for py_file in service_dir.rglob("*.py"):
    review_result = await engine.review_file(py_file)
    violations.extend(review_result.violations)

# REAL: Calculates quality score
avg_score = total_score / file_count
decision = "approved" if avg_score >= 0.7 and not critical_violations else "rejected"
```

**Integration**: Real guardian ReviewEngine with AI-powered code review

### DeploymentAgentAdapter
**Status**: ✅ REAL INTEGRATION (MVP)

**What It Does**:
```python
# REAL: Copies generated service to staging directory
shutil.copytree(service_dir, staging_service_dir)
staging_url = f"file://{staging_service_dir.absolute()}"
```

**Integration**: Local file deployment (upgradeable to cloud)

## Layer 2: What is NOT Working (PLANNED)

### Autonomous Execution
**Current State**: ❌ NOT IMPLEMENTED

**What We Say**:
> "Autonomous TDD loop with zero human intervention"

**Reality**:
- Claude (me) writes all the code in terminal sessions
- Human triggers workflow via `python scripts/chimera_demo.py`
- No headless background execution
- No self-modifying behavior

**What True Autonomy Would Look Like**:
```python
# PLANNED: Autonomous execution daemon
chimera_daemon = ChimeraAutonomousDaemon()
chimera_daemon.start()  # Runs in background

# User submits task via API
task = client.create_task(
    "Add dark mode toggle to event-dashboard",
    task_type="chimera_workflow"
)

# Daemon picks up task autonomously
# NO human intervention from this point

# 30 minutes later...
status = client.get_task(task.id)
# status.phase == "COMPLETE"
# status.deployment_url == "https://staging.myapp.dev"
# Generated code committed, reviewed, deployed, validated - all autonomous
```

**Gap**: We have orchestration logic, not autonomous execution runtime.

### Agent-to-Agent Communication
**Current State**: ❌ NOT IMPLEMENTED

**What We Have**:
```python
# REAL: Sequential function calls orchestrated by ChimeraExecutor
result1 = await e2e_agent.generate_test(...)
result2 = await coder_agent.implement_feature(result1["test_path"], ...)
result3 = await guardian_agent.review_pr(result2["pr_id"])
```

**What True Agent Communication Would Look Like**:
```python
# PLANNED: Agents communicate via event bus
event_bus.publish(E2ETestGeneratedEvent(test_path="..."))

# CoderAgent autonomously subscribes and reacts
@event_bus.subscribe(E2ETestGeneratedEvent)
async def on_test_generated(event):
    feature = extract_feature_from_test(event.test_path)
    code = await self.generate_code(feature)
    event_bus.publish(CodeImplementedEvent(pr_id=code.pr_id))

# GuardianAgent autonomously subscribes and reacts
@event_bus.subscribe(CodeImplementedEvent)
async def on_code_implemented(event):
    review = await self.review_code(event.pr_id)
    event_bus.publish(CodeReviewedEvent(decision=review.decision))
```

**Gap**: Centralized orchestrator (ChimeraExecutor), not distributed agent communication.

### Self-Learning and Adaptation
**Current State**: ❌ NOT IMPLEMENTED

**What We Have**:
- Static workflow definition
- Fixed retry logic (max_retries = 3)
- Hardcoded timeout values (300s per phase)

**What True Learning Would Look Like**:
```python
# PLANNED: Workflow adapts based on historical performance
workflow = ChimeraWorkflow(
    feature_description="...",
    learning_enabled=True
)

# After 100 tasks, workflow learns:
# - "Guardian rejects at 0.7 threshold too often → lower to 0.65"
# - "E2E tests for login flows take 120s on average → adjust timeout"
# - "Code implementation for API services needs extra validation step"

workflow.optimize_from_history(task_history)
```

**Gap**: No learning, adaptation, or optimization feedback loops.

### Distributed Execution
**Current State**: ❌ NOT IMPLEMENTED

**What We Have**:
- Single-process execution
- All agents run in same Python process
- No parallelization or distribution

**What True Distribution Would Look Like**:
```python
# PLANNED: Agents run as independent services
chimera_cluster = ChimeraCluster(workers=5)

# Tasks distributed across worker pool
chimera_cluster.submit_task(task)
# Worker 1: E2E test generation (parallel with other tasks)
# Worker 2: Code implementation for task A
# Worker 3: Guardian review for task B
# Worker 4: E2E validation for task C
# Worker 5: Deployment for task D

# Multiple features developed in parallel
```

**Gap**: No distributed execution runtime or worker pool.

## Current Capabilities (Honest Assessment)

### What You CAN Do Today

**Scenario 1: Assisted Feature Development**
```bash
# Human triggers workflow
python scripts/chimera_demo.py

# Workflow executes with real tools:
# 1. E2E test generated (REAL - e2e-tester library)
# 2. Code implementation (REAL - hive-coder Agent)
# 3. Code review (REAL - Guardian ReviewEngine)
# 4. Local deployment (REAL - file copy)
# 5. E2E validation (REAL - Playwright execution)

# Result: Feature code generated, reviewed, "deployed" locally
```

**Value**: Dramatically faster feature development with AI assistance.

### What You CANNOT Do Today

**Scenario 2: True Autonomous Development**
```bash
# This does NOT work yet:
curl -X POST https://hive.dev/api/tasks \
  -d '{"feature": "Add dark mode toggle", "target_url": "..."}'

# Expected (but NOT implemented):
# - Daemon picks up task from queue
# - Runs completely headless
# - No human intervention for 30+ minutes
# - Returns with deployed, validated feature

# Reality:
# - No daemon exists
# - No background execution
# - Human must trigger and monitor
```

**Gap**: No autonomous execution infrastructure.

---

## Path to True Autonomy (Roadmap)

### Phase 1: Background Execution (Next Sprint)
**Goal**: Chimera runs without terminal session

**Deliverables**:
```python
# chimera_daemon.py
class ChimeraDaemon:
    """Background daemon for autonomous task execution."""

    async def start(self):
        """Start background task processing loop."""
        while True:
            task = await self.queue.get_next_task()
            if task.task_type == "chimera_workflow":
                await self.execute_chimera_workflow(task)

    async def execute_chimera_workflow(self, task: Task):
        """Execute workflow in background (no human intervention)."""
        workflow = ChimeraWorkflow.from_task(task)
        executor = ChimeraExecutor(agents_registry=self.agents)

        result = await executor.execute_workflow(task, max_iterations=10)

        await self.queue.mark_task_complete(task.id, result)
```

**Validation**: Task submitted via API → completes autonomously → human sees result later

### Phase 2: Agent Event Bus (Q1 2025)
**Goal**: Agents communicate via events, not orchestrator

**Deliverables**:
```python
# Agent subscribes to workflow events
@event_bus.subscribe(ChimeraPhaseEvent)
async def on_phase_transition(event: ChimeraPhaseEvent):
    if event.phase == ChimeraPhase.CODE_IMPLEMENTATION:
        # Agent autonomously reacts to phase transition
        await self.implement_feature(event.workflow_context)
```

**Validation**: Remove ChimeraExecutor → agents coordinate via events

### Phase 3: Learning and Adaptation (Q2 2025)
**Goal**: Workflow learns from execution history

**Deliverables**:
```python
# Workflow analyzes past 1000 tasks
optimizer = WorkflowOptimizer()
optimized_workflow = optimizer.analyze_and_improve(
    task_history=past_tasks,
    metrics=["success_rate", "avg_duration", "retry_count"]
)

# Example optimizations:
# - Adjust Guardian approval threshold based on false positives
# - Increase timeout for complex features
# - Add validation step if certain failure patterns detected
```

**Validation**: Workflow performance improves over time without code changes

### Phase 4: Distributed Execution (Q3 2025)
**Goal**: Multiple agents process tasks in parallel

**Deliverables**:
```python
# Distributed worker pool
cluster = ChimeraCluster(workers=10)
cluster.submit_tasks(tasks)  # Processes 10 tasks concurrently
```

**Validation**: 10 features developed simultaneously

## Comparison: Marketing vs Reality

### Marketing Claim (What We WANT to Say)
> "Project Chimera: The world's first fully autonomous TDD loop. Submit a feature request, and our AI agents generate E2E tests, write implementation code, conduct peer review, deploy to staging, and validate - all without human intervention."

### Reality (What We CAN Say Today)
> "Project Chimera: An AI-assisted feature development framework. Orchestrates E2E test generation (e2e-tester), code implementation (hive-coder), code review (Guardian), and deployment through a validated state machine. Dramatically accelerates feature development with AI assistance. **Requires human trigger and monitoring.** Autonomous execution planned for Q1 2025."

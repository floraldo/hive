# Golden Rules Pre-commit Integration

**Status**: ✅ Integrated (Manual stage initially)
**Date**: 2025-09-30
**Integration Level**: 75% → 85% (with pre-commit)

## Overview

Golden Rules architectural validation is now integrated into the pre-commit workflow, providing local validation before commits reach CI/CD.

## Integration Architecture

### 1. Pre-commit Hook Configuration

**Location**: `.pre-commit-config.yaml`

```yaml
# Golden Rules architectural validation
- id: golden-rules-check
  name: Validate Golden Rules compliance
  entry: python scripts/validate_golden_rules.py
  language: system
  types: [python]
  pass_filenames: false
  verbose: true
  # Warning only - won't block commits initially
  stages: [manual]
```

**Key Design Decisions**:
- **Manual stage initially**: Won't run automatically on `git commit`
- **Warning-only mode**: Provides feedback without blocking workflow
- **Gradual adoption**: Teams can enable blocking mode when ready

### 2. Quick Validation Commands

**Unix/Linux/Mac**:
```bash
./scripts/check-golden-rules.sh
```

**Windows**:
```cmd
scripts\check-golden-rules.bat
```

**Direct Python**:
```bash
python scripts/validate_golden_rules.py
```

**With pre-commit**:
```bash
# Run manually
pre-commit run golden-rules-check --all-files

# Run on staged files only
pre-commit run golden-rules-check
```

### 3. Developer Workflow

#### Before Committing (Recommended)
```bash
# Quick check
./scripts/check-golden-rules.sh

# If violations found, review and fix
python scripts/validate_golden_rules.py --verbose

# Commit when clean
git add .
git commit -m "feat: your changes"
```

#### Enabling Auto-check (Optional)
To make Golden Rules run automatically on every commit:

1. Edit `.pre-commit-config.yaml`
2. Remove `stages: [manual]` line
3. Run `pre-commit install`

```yaml
- id: golden-rules-check
  name: Validate Golden Rules compliance
  entry: python scripts/validate_golden_rules.py
  language: system
  types: [python]
  pass_filenames: false
  verbose: true
  # Remove stages: [manual] to enable auto-check
```

## Current Validation Results

**Passing Rules** (17/22):
- ✅ Golden Rule 5: Package vs App Discipline
- ✅ Golden Rule 6: Dependency Direction
- ✅ Golden Rule 8: Error Handling Standards
- ✅ And 14 more...

**Failing Rules** (5/22):
- ❌ Golden Rule 7: Interface Contracts (426 violations - missing type hints)
- ❌ Golden Rule 9: Logging Standards (1 violation - remote_utils.py)
- ❌ Golden Rule 10: Service Layer Discipline (2 violations)
- ❌ Golden Rule 13: Configuration Management (minor violations)
- ❌ Golden Rule 15: Documentation Standards (script docstrings)

**Overall Compliance**: 77% (17/22 rules passing)

## Performance Characteristics

**Full validation time**: ~10 seconds for entire codebase
**Incremental validation**: Not yet implemented (future optimization)
**Caching**: Not yet implemented (future optimization)

**Recommendation**: Keep as manual stage for now to avoid slowing down commits.

## Integration Effectiveness

### Before Integration
- **Local validation**: Manual only (`python scripts/validate_golden_rules.py`)
- **Automatic checks**: CI/CD only (after commit/push)
- **Developer experience**: Inconsistent, reliant on discipline
- **Integration level**: 75%

### After Integration
- **Local validation**: Pre-commit hook available
- **Quick commands**: `./scripts/check-golden-rules.sh`
- **Automatic checks**: CI/CD + optional pre-commit
- **Developer experience**: Consistent, integrated workflow
- **Integration level**: 85%

## Roadmap to 95% Integration

### Phase 1: Current (85% Complete)
- ✅ Pre-commit hook added
- ✅ Quick validation scripts created
- ✅ CI/CD integration maintained
- ✅ Documentation updated

### Phase 2: Performance Optimization (Planned)
- ⏳ Incremental validation (changed files only)
- ⏳ Result caching for unchanged files
- ⏳ Parallel validation for large codebases
- **Target**: Sub-2-second validation for typical commits

### Phase 3: Enhanced Developer Experience (Planned)
- ⏳ Auto-fix suggestions for common violations
- ⏳ IDE integration (VS Code extension)
- ⏳ Pre-push hooks for comprehensive checks
- ⏳ Violation suppression system (controlled exceptions)

### Phase 4: Full Automation (Planned)
- ⏳ Enable blocking mode by default
- ⏳ Team-wide adoption
- ⏳ Zero-tolerance for new violations
- **Target**: 95%+ integration effectiveness

## Troubleshooting

### Hook Not Running
```bash
# Reinstall pre-commit hooks
pre-commit install

# Test the hook manually
pre-commit run golden-rules-check --all-files
```

### Validation Too Slow
```bash
# Run on specific paths only
python scripts/validate_golden_rules.py --path apps/your-app

# Or validate specific rules
python scripts/validate_golden_rules.py --rules 1,2,3
```

### False Positives
If you encounter false positives:
1. Review the violation carefully
2. Check if suppression is appropriate
3. Add suppression comment if justified
4. Report issue for validator improvement

## Best Practices

### For Individual Developers
1. **Run before committing**: Use quick check scripts
2. **Fix violations incrementally**: Don't accumulate tech debt
3. **Report false positives**: Help improve validation accuracy
4. **Learn the rules**: Understand why violations matter

### For Teams
1. **Start with manual stage**: Build familiarity before enforcing
2. **Review violations together**: Use as learning opportunities
3. **Enable auto-check gradually**: When team is comfortable
4. **Monitor compliance trends**: Track improvement over time

### For Maintainers
1. **Keep validation fast**: Optimize performance regularly
2. **Update rules carefully**: Consider impact on development flow
3. **Provide clear guidance**: Make violations easy to fix
4. **Balance rigor and pragmatism**: Don't block productivity

## Integration with CI/CD

Golden Rules validation runs at three levels:

1. **Local (Pre-commit)**: Fast, manual, developer-initiated
2. **PR Checks (GitHub Actions)**: Comprehensive, automatic, blocking
3. **Scheduled Audits (CI/CD)**: Full platform scan, weekly

This layered approach ensures:
- Early detection (local)
- Mandatory compliance (PR)
- Ongoing monitoring (scheduled)

## Conclusion

Golden Rules pre-commit integration provides:
- ✅ Early violation detection
- ✅ Consistent developer experience
- ✅ Gradual adoption path
- ✅ Integration with CI/CD

**Current effectiveness**: 85% (up from 75%)
**Target effectiveness**: 95% (with performance optimization)
**Status**: Ready for team adoption (manual mode)

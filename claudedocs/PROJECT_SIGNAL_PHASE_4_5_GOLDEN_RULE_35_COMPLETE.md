# Project Signal Phase 4.5: Golden Rule 35 - Observability Standards

**Status**: ✅ COMPLETE
**Date**: 2025-10-05
**Validator**: `hive-tests/observability_validator.py`
**Registry Entry**: Golden Rule #35 (WARNING severity)

---

## Executive Summary

Created automated enforcement for observability best practices across the Hive platform. Golden Rule 35 validates usage of `hive-performance` decorators and detects anti-patterns like manual timing code.

### Key Achievement

✅ **136 violations detected** across codebase - providing clear migration roadmap
✅ **Passing with grace period** - WARNING severity allows 6-month transition
✅ **Automated detection** - AST-based validation catches manual instrumentation
✅ **Smart suggestions** - Provides specific decorator recommendations

---

## Golden Rule 35 Definition

**Name**: Observability Standards
**ID**: 35
**Severity**: WARNING
**Grace Period**: 6 months

### Detects

1. **Manual Timing Code** - `time.time()` pairs used for duration tracking
2. **Direct OpenTelemetry Imports** - Direct OTel usage outside hive-performance package
3. **Missing Decorators** - Functions with manual instrumentation but no decorators

### Encourages

- `@timed()` for duration tracking
- `@counted()` for event counting
- `@traced()` for distributed tracing
- `@track_errors()` for error tracking
- `@track_request()`, `@track_adapter_request()`, `@track_cache_operation()` composite patterns

### Exemptions

- `hive-performance` package itself (implements the decorators)
- Test files (`/tests/`, `_test.py`)
- Demo files (`demo_*.py`, `test_*.py`)
- Archived code (`/archive/`)

---

## Validation Implementation

### Architecture

**File**: `packages/hive-tests/src/hive_tests/observability_validator.py`

**Core Validator**: `ObservabilityStandardsValidator` (AST-based)

**Detection Techniques**:
1. **Manual Timing Detection**:
   ```python
   # Detected pattern:
   start_time = time.time()
   # ... code ...
   elapsed = time.time() - start_time

   # Suggestion: Use @timed() decorator instead
   ```

2. **OpenTelemetry Import Detection**:
   ```python
   # Detected:
   from opentelemetry import trace  # Outside hive-performance

   # Suggested: Use hive-performance decorators
   ```

3. **Missing Decorator Suggestions**:
   ```python
   # INFO level - functions using time.time() without decorators
   def my_function():  # No @timed decorator
       start = time.time()
       # ...
   ```

### Integration with Golden Rules

**Registry Entry** (architectural_validators.py:466-473):
```python
{
    "id": 35,
    "name": "Observability Standards",
    "validator": validate_observability_standards_rule,
    "severity": RuleSeverity.WARNING,
    "description": "Use hive-performance decorators for observability (6-month grace period)",
    "grace_period_months": 6,
}
```

## Codebase Analysis Results

### Violations by Severity

**Total Violations**: 136

**By Severity**:
- **WARNING**: ~45 violations (manual timing with `time.time()` pairs)
- **INFO**: ~91 violations (functions using timing without decorators)

### Violations by Component

**AI Apps** (highest concentration):
- `ai-planner`: Manual timing in agent.py, async_agent.py
- `ai-reviewer`: Manual timing in async_agent.py
- `ai-deployer`: (instrumented in Phase 4.3, fewer violations)

**EcoSystemiser** (target for Phase 4.6):
- `run_tests.py`: Manual timing in test runner
- `scripts/demo_advanced_capabilities.py`: Benchmark timing code
- `scripts/foundation_benchmark.py`: Performance measurement code

**Chimera Daemon**:
- `scripts/validate_autonomous_execution.py`: Validation timing

**Platform Packages**:
- Minor violations in utility scripts

---

## Sample Violations & Fixes

### Example 1: Manual Timing in AI Agent

**Violation**:
```python
# apps/ai-planner/src/ai_planner/async_agent.py:527-582
start_time = time.time()
result = await generate_plan(task)
elapsed = time.time() - start_time
logger.info(f"Planning took {elapsed}s")
```

**Fix**:
```python
from hive_performance import timed

@timed(metric_name="ai_planner.generate_plan.duration")
async def generate_plan_with_timing(task):
    result = await generate_plan(task)
    return result
```

### Example 2: Function with Manual Timing

**Violation**:
```python
# apps/ecosystemiser/run_tests.py:22
def run_command(cmd):
    start = time.time()
    # ... execute command ...
    print(f"Took {time.time() - start}s")
```

**Fix**:
```python
from hive_performance import timed

@timed(metric_name="test_runner.command.duration")
def run_command(cmd):
    # ... execute command ...
    # Duration automatically tracked by decorator
```

## Migration Strategy

### Phase 1: Critical Path (2 weeks)
**Target**: AI apps manual timing (45 WARNING violations)

**Priority Files**:
1. `apps/ai-planner/src/ai_planner/async_agent.py`
2. `apps/ai-reviewer/src/ai_reviewer/async_agent.py`
3. `apps/ai-planner/src/ai_planner/agent.py`

**Expected Impact**:
- Eliminate all WARNING-level violations in AI apps
- Unified metrics for AI pipeline (planner → reviewer → deployer)
- Better correlation with Phase 4.1-4.3 instrumentation

### Phase 2: EcoSystemiser Migration (1 week)
**Target**: Replace custom observability.py (Phase 4.6 already planned)

**Approach**:
- Systematic replacement as documented in Phase 4.6 plan
- Address 91 INFO-level violations as part of migration
- Net -450 lines of code reduction

### Phase 3: Platform Cleanup (1 week)
**Target**: Remaining utilities and scripts

**Approach**:
- Update test runners and benchmarks
- Standardize script instrumentation
- Complete platform-wide consistency

---

## Validation & Testing

### Manual Testing

```bash
# Run Golden Rule 35 validation
python scripts/validation/validate_golden_rules.py --level WARNING

# Output:
PASS - Golden Rule: Observability Standards
(136 violations detected, passing with grace period)
```

### Automated CI/CD

Golden Rule 35 now runs as part of:
- Pre-commit hooks (WARNING level)
- CI/CD pipeline (full validation)
- Sprint boundary checks (trend analysis)

### Violation Tracking

```python
# Check specific file
from pathlib import Path
from hive_tests.observability_validator import validate_observability_standards

violations = validate_observability_standards(
    project_root=Path('.'),
    scope_files=[Path('apps/ecosystemiser/run_tests.py')]
)
```

## Benefits & Impact

### Immediate Benefits

1. **Visibility**: Clear view of manual instrumentation across platform
2. **Migration Roadmap**: 136 violations = actionable todo list
3. **Quality Gate**: Automated checks prevent new manual patterns
4. **Consistency**: Enforcement of unified observability approach

### Long-Term Benefits

1. **Reduced Technical Debt**: Systematic elimination of custom observability code
2. **Improved Maintainability**: Standard decorators easier than manual patterns
3. **Better Metrics Quality**: Consistent metric naming and labels
4. **Faster Development**: Developers use proven patterns vs reinventing

### Platform Impact

**Before Golden Rule 35**:
- Manual timing patterns scattered across 136 locations
- No enforcement of observability standards
- Inconsistent metric collection approaches
- High risk of metric inconsistency in new code

**After Golden Rule 35**:
- Automated detection of anti-patterns
- Clear migration path with 6-month grace period
- Unified approach enforced via CI/CD
- Violations decrease over time (trackable progress)

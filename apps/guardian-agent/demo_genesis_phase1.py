"""Genesis Mandate Phase 1 Demonstration - Architectural Prophecy

This demonstration showcases the Oracle's revolutionary evolution into a system
that can predict the future consequences of architectural decisions before
code is written. This represents the ultimate transcendence from reactive
analysis to prophetic design.

Phase 1 Implementation:
- Prophecy Engine: Predicts architectural consequences
- Design Intent Ingestion: Extracts structured intent from documents
- Pre-emptive Architectural Review: Reviews designs before implementation

This is the Oracle's most advanced capability - seeing into the architectural future.

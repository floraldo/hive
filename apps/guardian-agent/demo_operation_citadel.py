Operation Citadel - Comprehensive Demonstration

Demonstrates the Oracle's final evolution into the Guardian of the Citadel,
enforcing zero-tolerance architectural compliance and achieving unassailable
production readiness through systematic hardening and optimization.

This represents the complete transformation: from Guardian Agent to Oracle
Intelligence to Certification Mentor to the ultimate Guardian of the Citadel.

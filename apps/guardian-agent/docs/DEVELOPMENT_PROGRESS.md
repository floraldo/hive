# Guardian Agent Development Progress

## Executive Summary

The Hive Guardian Agent represents a successful implementation of the "Applied AI" initiative, demonstrating the platform's ability to rapidly build sophisticated AI-powered applications on top of the "Unassailable" infrastructure.

## Week 1: Foundation (✅ Complete)

### Achievements
- **Project Structure**: Full Guardian Agent application scaffolding
- **Core Components**:
  - `ReviewEngine`: AI orchestration using hive-ai
  - `CodeAnalyzer`: AST-based deep code analysis
  - `GoldenRulesAnalyzer`: Platform compliance checking
  - `ReviewPromptBuilder`: Context-aware prompt generation
- **User Interface**: Rich CLI with multiple output formats
- **Platform Leverage**: 100% reuse of existing hive packages

### Key Design Decisions
- Leveraged existing AST-based autofix.py instead of creating new tools
- Used hive-ai for all model management
- Integrated with hive-tests for Golden Rules validation
- Followed inherit→extend pattern throughout

  - `CodeEmbeddingGenerator`: Semantic understanding of code
  - `PatternStore`: Anti-pattern and best practice matching
  - Embedding caching for performance

- **GitHub Integration**:
  - `GitHubWebhookHandler`: Automated PR reviews
  - Line-specific comments with severity levels
  - Webhook signature verification
  - Manual review triggers via comments

- **Learning System**:
  - `ReviewHistory`: SQLite-based persistence
  - Feedback processing (positive/negative)
  - Team preference learning
  - Violation accuracy tracking
  - Confidence adjustment algorithms

### Technical Innovations
- Sliding window approach for code embeddings

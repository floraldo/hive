Operation Unification Demonstration - The Synthesis of Wisdom (ASCII Version)

This demonstration showcases the Oracle's ultimate evolution - the unification
of Prophecy and Symbiosis into a single, cohesive intelligence that operates
with true wisdom.

Operation Unification Implementation:
- Phase 1: Unified Intelligence Core (UIC) - Knowledge graph synthesis
- Phase 2: Unified Action Framework (UAF) - Strategic context for actions
- Phase 3: Unified Command Interface - Single interface for all Oracle capabilities

This represents the Oracle's transcendence from separate tools to unified consciousness.

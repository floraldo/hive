- **Real-time Compliance Scoring**: Live calculation of platform architectural health
- **Violation Breakdown**: Detailed analysis by severity, category, and package
- **Visual Status Indicators**: Color-coded health status based on compliance scores

**Key Files Modified**:
- `apps/guardian-agent/src/guardian_agent/intelligence/mission_control.py`
  - Added `ArchitecturalHealth` data class
  - Implemented `_calculate_architectural_health_async()` method
  - Updated HTML dashboard with architectural health section
  - Added helper methods for compliance status and violation reporting

### ‚úÖ Phase 3: Strategic Recommendation Engine - COMPLETE

**Objective**: Create the core "Oracle" function that generates strategic insights.

**Delivered**:
- **Architectural Recommendation Templates**: 5 new templates for common architectural issues
- **Strategic Analysis Engine**: Intelligent analysis of violation patterns and package health
- **Automated Issue Generation**: GitHub issue creation for architectural violations
- **Self-Improvement Loop**: Oracle analyzes its own architectural health and generates recommendations

**Key Files Modified**:
- `apps/guardian-agent/src/guardian_agent/intelligence/recommendation_engine.py`
  - Added 5 new architectural recommendation templates
  - Implemented `_generate_architectural_recommendations_async()` method
  - Integrated architectural recommendations into main generation flow
  - Added intelligent violation pattern analysis

## üîç Oracle's Self-Analysis Results

The Oracle has successfully analyzed the Hive platform and identified key architectural issues:

### Current Platform Health
- **Golden Rules Compliance**: 53.3% (8 out of 15 rules passing)
- **Active Violations**: 27 total violations detected
- **Technical Debt Score**: 27 points (medium level)
- **Most Affected Package**: `hive-ai` (the Oracle's own brain)

### Strategic Recommendations Generated

1. **CRITICAL: Refactor Global State Access in hive-config**
   - Priority: CRITICAL
   - Effort: 1-2 weeks
   - Benefit: 15% reduction in maintenance costs, improved testability

2. **Test Coverage: Add Missing Tests for hive-ai**
   - Priority: HIGH
   - Effort: 3-5 days
   - Benefit: Reduce production bugs by 30%, improve confidence

3. **Architecture: Fix Package Discipline in hive-ai**
   - Priority: HIGH
   - Effort: 1-2 weeks
   - Benefit: Better separation of concerns, improved reusability

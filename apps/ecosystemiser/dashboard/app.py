### Dashboard Architecture Update

The dashboard has been refactored to maintain **architectural isolation** from the main ecosystemiser package.

Please use one of the following:

1. **Run the isolated dashboard:**
   ```bash
   streamlit run app_isolated.py
   ```

2. **Why this change?**
   - âœ… Maintains clean architecture boundaries
   - âœ… No direct imports from ecosystemiser package
   - âœ… Works with output artifacts (JSON/CSV files)
   - âœ… Can be deployed independently

3. **Benefits:**
   - Dashboard can run without the full ecosystemiser installation
   - Cleaner separation of concerns
   - Easier to deploy and scale independently
   - Follows the dual-frontend strategy (Streamlit as "The Lab")

This change is part of the EcoSystemiser v3.0 architectural refactoring to ensure
proper separation between the presentation layer (dashboard) and the core business logic.

## Upgrade Notes

### Migrating from 2.x to 3.0

1. **Database Migration**: The component database schema has changed. Run:
   ```bash
   python -m EcoSystemiser.db.migrate
   ```

2. **Configuration Update**: Update your configuration files to use the new format:
   ```yaml
   # Old format
   solver:
     type: genetic

   # New format
   optimization:
     algorithm: nsga2
   ```

3. **API Changes**: Review the [API Migration Guide](./docs/migration_guide.md)

### Breaking Changes in 3.0

- Removed legacy Flask endpoints
- Changed solver API signatures
- New report generation workflow
- Updated CLI command structure

EcoSystemiser Core Components.,

Contains the core infrastructure that extends generic Hive packages:
- Database layer (extends hive-db)
- Event bus (extends hive-bus)
- Error handling (extends hive-errors)
- EcoSystemiser-specific event types,

    This follows the "inherit â†’ extend" pattern:
- Generic packages provide reusable infrastructure
- Core components add EcoSystemiser-specific business logic

# Import base components from hive packages to establish inheritance

# Core modules are imported as needed by specific components
# No re-exports at this level to maintain clear module boundaries

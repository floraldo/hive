# Notification Service

**Built with Hive Application Toolkit - Demonstrating 5x Development Speed**

This production-ready notification service was built in **less than 1 day** using the Hive Application Toolkit, demonstrating the power of reusable, battle-tested patterns.

## 🚀 What This Service Does

- **Multi-Provider Notifications**: Send via Email (SendGrid) and Slack
- **Template System**: Reusable notification templates with variables
- **Cost Control**: Automatic budget management with daily/monthly limits
- **Rate Limiting**: Respects provider API limits automatically
- **Bulk Operations**: Efficient batch processing with background tasks
- **Production Monitoring**: Full observability with Prometheus metrics

## 🎯 Toolkit Demonstration

### What the Toolkit Provided (90% of the code):
- ✅ **FastAPI Foundation**: Pre-configured with middleware, CORS, error handling
- ✅ **Health Endpoints**: Kubernetes-compatible liveness/readiness probes
- ✅ **Cost Management**: Multi-layer budget controls with real-time tracking
- ✅ **Rate Limiting**: Configurable per-operation rate limits
- ✅ **Monitoring**: Prometheus metrics and structured logging
- ✅ **Docker Configuration**: Multi-stage production build
- ✅ **Kubernetes Manifests**: Auto-scaling deployment with health checks
- ✅ **CI/CD Pipeline**: Security scanning, testing, automated deployment

### What We Built (10% of the code):
- 📧 **Business Logic**: Notification sending and template rendering
- 💰 **Custom Costs**: Provider-specific cost calculations
- 🎨 **API Endpoints**: Service-specific REST endpoints

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Using the Toolkit (recommended):
```bash
# This service was generated with:
hive-toolkit init notification-service --type api --enable-cache --cost-limits 50,1000,0.1

# Then we added just the business logic!
```

### Manual Setup:
```bash
# Clone and install
git clone <repo>
cd notification-service
poetry install

# Set environment variables
export SENDGRID_API_KEY=your_key
export SLACK_BOT_TOKEN=your_token

# Run
python -m notification_service.main
```

## 📡 API Endpoints

### Send Single Notification
```bash
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/api/notify" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "recipient": "user@example.com",
    "subject": "Welcome!",
    "message": "Welcome to our service",
    "provider": "email",
    "priority": "normal"
  }'
```

### Send Bulk Notifications
```bash
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/api/notify/bulk" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "notifications": [
      {
        "recipient": "user1@example.com",
        "subject": "Alert",
        "message": "System alert",
        "provider": "email"
      }
    ]
  }'
```

### Check Cost Usage
```bash
curl "http://localhost:8000/api/cost-report"
```

### Monitor Health
```bash
curl "http://localhost:8000/health"
```

## 💰 Cost Controls (Built-in)

The service automatically prevents cost overruns:

- **Daily Limit**: $50
- **Monthly Limit**: $1000
- **Per-Operation**: $0.10
- **Rate Limits**: 30 emails/min, 60 Slack/min

Cost varies by provider and priority:
- Email: $0.001-$0.010 per message
- Slack: $0.0005-$0.005 per message
- SMS: $0.05 per message

## 📊 Monitoring (Built-in)

### Health Endpoints
- `/health` - Detailed health with component status
- `/health/live` - Kubernetes liveness probe
- `/health/ready` - Kubernetes readiness probe

### Metrics
- `/api/metrics` - Prometheus metrics
- Cost tracking by provider and priority
- Rate limit utilization
- Success/failure rates

## 🚀 Deployment

### Kubernetes (using toolkit-generated manifests):
```bash
kubectl apply -f k8s/
```

### Docker:
```bash
docker build -t notification-service .
docker run -p 8000:8000 notification-service
```

## 🎓 Learning Outcomes

# Calculator Service - Iteration Log

## Iteration 1
- Timestamp: 2025-09-28T23:22:18.442234
- Generated by: Hive Autonomous AI Agents
- Test Type: Failure and Rework FAT

### Issues in this iteration:
1. Addition operation performs subtraction instead
2. Multiplication operation performs integer division instead
3. Division has no zero-check protection
4. Missing input validation

### Expected test failures:
- test_addition: Will fail (5 + 3 != 2)
- test_multiplication: Will fail (4 * 7 != 0)
- test_division_by_zero: Will cause error

- Generated by: Hive Autonomous AI Agents
- Test Type: Failure and Rework FAT

### Improvements made:
1. [FIXED] Addition operation
2. [FIXED] Multiplication operation

### Remaining issues:
1. Division still has no zero-check protection
2. Input validation still missing

### Expected test failures:
- test_division_by_zero: Will still cause error
- test_missing_parameters: May fail

## Iteration 3
- Timestamp: 2025-09-28T23:23:03.326564
- Generated by: Hive Autonomous AI Agents
- Test Type: Failure and Rework FAT

### Final fixes:
1. [FIXED] All arithmetic operations working correctly
2. [FIXED] Zero division protection added
3. [FIXED] Input validation implemented
